    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup black olives</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked crumbled sausage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Stir in the yeast mixture. When the
            dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 8
            minutes. </li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and
            let it rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). If you are baking the pizza on a pizza stone, you may place
            your toppings on the dough, and bake immediately. If you are baking your pizza in a pan, lightly oil the
            pan, and
            let the dough rise for 15 or 20 minutes before topping and baking it.</li>
        <li>Roll dough with a rolling pin, and transfer to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with
            cornmeal. Spread with pizza sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Arrange desired toppings over mozzarella
            cheese,
            and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
