As part of The Odin Project

So far in this project, most of the new things I've learned are to do with git and terminal commands which I never used before.

I now know how to go from creating a repo in Github to staging commits

- Copy SSH key
- `cd` into where you want to "put" the repo
- `git clone <>`
- To make a new file use `touch`
  - Then there's a 3 step process - "First you add, then you commit, then you push"
    - `git add` followed by a filename or a . for all files
    - `git commit -m` followed by your commit message
      - Follow the 7 tips
    - `git push` and the you can specify the remote branch name and then "Main"
      - `git push origin main`
